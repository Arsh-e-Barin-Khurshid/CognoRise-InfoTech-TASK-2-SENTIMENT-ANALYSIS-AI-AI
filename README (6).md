# **Sentiment Analysis AI Project**
## 1. Project Overview

This project explores sentiment analysis applied to both song lyrics and literary texts to understand how different forms of written expression convey emotions. By analyzing sentiment polarity and categorizing emotional content, the project aims to uncover any notable patterns or differences between how various genres and formats express emotions. The goal is to provide insights into cultural or genre-specific tendencies in emotional expression through comparative analysis.


## 2. Data Sources
## 2.1. Song Lyrics

The dataset for song lyrics includes files from popular artists such as Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Eminem, and Taylor Swift. Each file contains lyrics and associated metadata that are used to perform sentiment analysis. By examining lyrics from these diverse artists, the project aims to reveal how different music genres and styles influence emotional expression.






## 2.2. Literary Texts

The dataset for literary texts is sourced from a CSV file containing detailed information about various books. This includes book titles, authors, and their respective text content. Analyzing these texts provides a contrast to the emotional expressions found in song lyrics, offering insights into how literary genres and styles differ in their portrayal of emotions.


## 3. Sentiment Polarity Distribution

This section examines the overall distribution of sentiment polarity scores across the datasets. Sentiment polarity measures the positivity or negativity of the content, with scores ranging from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive). The analysis provides an overview of how sentiments are distributed within the texts and helps identify whether certain types of content tend to be more positive or negative.


## 4. Sentiment Analysis by Genre

Here, the project compares average sentiment polarity scores across different genres of music and literary works. By grouping texts into various genres or categories and calculating the average sentiment scores for each, this analysis reveals how sentiment varies by genre. This comparison helps in understanding genre-specific tendencies in emotional expression.


## 5. Emotion Distribution Across Texts

This section provides a visual representation of the proportion of different emotions present in the datasets. By categorizing texts based on the emotions they evoke—such as joy, sadness, anger, etc.—this analysis shows which emotions are most prevalent. It helps in understanding the emotional landscape of both song lyrics and literary texts.


## 6. Emotional Comparison Between Genres

In this analysis, the frequency of different emotions is compared across genres. This involves examining how often specific emotions appear within different genres of music and literature. The comparison highlights genre-specific emotional tendencies and offers insights into how various types of texts evoke particular emotional responses.


## 7. Comparison of Sentiment Polarity Models

This section compares the sentiment polarity scores obtained from different sentiment analysis models, such as TextBlob and VADER. By evaluating and visualizing the sentiment scores provided by these models, the project assesses their performance and reliability in capturing sentiment from the texts. This comparison helps determine which model provides a more accurate representation of sentiment.


## 8. Comparison of Emotion Distribution Models

Here, the distribution of emotions classified by different models is compared. This involves analyzing how various sentiment analysis tools categorize emotions and whether their classifications align or diverge. The comparison provides insights into the effectiveness and consistency of different emotion classification models.


## 9. Insights and Interpretations

This section summarizes the key findings from the sentiment and emotional analyses. It includes insights into the overall sentiment trends, notable emotional patterns, and the performance of different models. The interpretations offer a comprehensive view of the emotional expression in song lyrics versus literary texts and highlight any significant differences or similarities.
